* Q1.) What are we doing here and how does it relate to what we know about SPI?

With clocks in SPI, the asynchronous communication requires the high state  to send data and low  state to recieve data. 


* Q2.) Explain how you might use the *f3d_delay_uS()* function
  within the *delay()* function to replace the delay loop
  below. What would you expect to be the advantage of using a
  timer over a delay loop?

You will get control with how long to set it and have a an easier time adjusting it


*    Q3.) Read chapter 12 in the lab manual which covers DMA (direct memory access). Why might DMA be important in improving the performance of your image display application?

*    Q4.) Research the FAT file system and describe the function of the file allocation table. Explain how the corruption of an entry in the table can cause part of a file to be lost.

*    Q5.) What is the difference between FAT16 and FAT32?
