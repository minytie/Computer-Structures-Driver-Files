-Files are in Nate Krumman's FINAL folder for CS-SPRING-2016 github directory


Describe each of the tasks that you were responsible for performing and how each contributed to the overall project. [15]

	-Responsible for driver files and fixing the driver fiels for a second nunchuk
	-creating the Makefile used to compile and link code for board download and testing
	-Helped debug game logic
	-Graphic logic for board
	-came up with structure and implementation of bitmaps and made a few designs
	-Fixed sound driver files
	-Most of time I was debugging the code

What technical challenges did you encounter in completing your tasks? [5]

	-A wii nunchuk we were using was broken totally in a hardware way, making all of our efforst to code a fix ineffective
	-UART on Nate's driver files didn't work properly, causing debugging issues
	-Difficult to debug peripherals
	-Massive logic arguments needed, lack of objects in C
	-Conceptual understanding of board and peices became difficutlt

What would you do differently if you could start the project over? [5]

	-Fixed UART and all other drivers before starting
	-Done a better job of using github forking and picked best driver files
	-Made structs and done game logic based upon a cleaner struct organization
