Q4)
Because the accelerometer measurements cannot distinguish earthâ€™s gravity from linear
acceleration or angular acceleration, fast motion causes pitch/roll calculation error which
then directly introduces an error to the heading calculation. In most cases, the fast motion
doesn't last long and the device goes back to a stationary position. So the heading accuracy
in an electronic compass means static accuracy when the device is still or without
acceleration.
